# AWS Free-Tier/Three-Tiered Network
This repo contains AWS CloudFormation Templates and dependencies to create a WordPress blog in AWS. The app will be loaded into a three-tier, secure VPC. Nevertheless, these templates will ONLY initiate free-tier resources.

This project serves more to build experience than to solve any practical issues associated with hosting a wordpress app on AWS. However, some of the cost-saving measures I implemented (such as running a NAT Instance rather than a NAT gateway, see section 4) may be of interest to individuals or small dev/test teams.

## Architectural Overview
This WordPress app is built on three-tier architecture. The design of the three tiers (presentation tier, app tier, and data tier) is modelled after the [WordPress: Best Practices on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/wordpress-best-practices-on-aws/) whitepaper. 

The three tiers are populated as follows:
 |Layer|Function|Resource|
 |---|---|---|
 | 1. Presentation tier | Dual purpose NAT Instance/Bastion server |t2.micro EC2 instance|
 |2. Application tier | WordPress server | t2.micro EC2 instance|
 |3. Data Tier|MySQL Database|db.t3.micro RDS instance (single AZ)|

I spin up these resources within a **VPC** generated by CloudFormation. Each resource is given its own subnet in a single availability zone (AZ). A second set of subnets is defined in a second AZ, which satisfies the subnet group requirements of RDS and allows for easy scaling in the future.

The VPC connects to the internet through an **Internet Gateway**. Only the presentation layer is a publicly accessible (i.e. has a route to the Internet Gateway defined). 

Note that I opt to create a NAT Instance out of an EC2 instance, rather than use AWS's built-in NAT Gateways. This is a cost-saving measure. See section 4 for more details.

## Initialize the VPC
#### TEMPLATE: 01_Network.json
This template lays down the necessary networking infrastructure for the app and database servers to come. The architecture is initialized in the first two AZs (alphabetically) in the region from which the template is run in CloudFormation. 

Instead of a NAT Gateway (which can cost nearly $40/month), an EC2 instance is spun up and configured to act as a NAT Instance. To be clear, NAT Gateways are better than this NAT Instance in nearly every environment. They are fully managed, scalable, and highly available. I only went with a NAT Instance as a cost-saving measure.

To configure the NAT Instance, I disable `SourceDestCheck` and run the following bootstrap script:
```
#!/bin/bash
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```
This design of this NAT instance was inspired by a [blog post](https://www.kabisa.nl/tech/cost-saving-with-nat-instances/) by Luk van den Borne from 2019. 

**NOTE: THE AMI USED FOR THIS INSTANCE IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN us-east-1.** To create a stack in a different region, change the AMI ID to one belonging to an Amazon Linux 2 image in your region.

 |Parameter|Function|
 |---|---|
 |EnvironmentName | An environment name that is prefixed to resource names |
 | VpcCIDR | Please enter the IP range (CIDR notation) for this VPC |
 | PublicSubnet1CIDR | Please enter the IP range (CIDR notation) for the public subnet in the first Availability Zone |
 | PublicSubnet2CIDR | Please enter the IP range (CIDR notation) for the public subnet in the second Availability Zone |        
 | PrivateAppSubnet1CIDR | Please enter the IP range (CIDR notation) for the (private) app subnet in the first Availability Zone |
 | PrivateAppSubnet2CIDR | Please enter the IP range (CIDR notation) for the (private) app subnet in the second Availability Zone |
 | PrivateDBSubnet1CIDR | Please enter the IP range (CIDR notation) for the (private) database subnet in the first Availability Zone |
 | PrivateDBSubnet2CIDR | Please enter the IP range (CIDR notation) for the (private) database subnet in the second Availability Zone |
 | SSHLocation | The IP address range that can be used to SSH to the EC2 instances |
 | KeyName | Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH access to the NAT instance. Note that the Securit Group associated with the NAT instance does not allow SSH traffic. However, the same instance will later be configured as a Bastion host which *does* allow SSH. |

 |Resource|Description|
 |---|---|
 VPC|A virtual private cloud with the CIDR block specified in the parameters
 InternetGateway|Default Internet Gateway
 InternetGatewayAttachment|Connect Internet Gateway to VPC
 PublicSubnet1 and PublicSubnet2|Makes a call to `"Fn::GetAZs"` to get a list of AZs in the region you are running the template in. Initializes a subnet in the first (Subnet1) or second (Subnet2) AZ in the region (alphabetically). `MapPublicIpOnLaunch` is set to `true`.
PrivateAppSubnet1/2 and PrivateDBSubnet1/2|Makes a call to `"Fn::GetAZs"` to get a list of AZs in the region you are running the template in. Initializes a subnet in the first (Subnet1) or second (Subnet2) AZ in the region (alphabetically).
NATSecurityGroup|Security group to be used by the NAT Instance. Enables HTTP/HTTPS communication to and from any IP.
NATInstance1|Initializes an t2.micro (free-tier) EC2 instance inside PublicSubnet1. The bootstrap script and `SourceDestCheck=false` attribute together enable IP forwarding (i.e. NAT funcationality). An SSH key pair is associated with the instance for later use. **NOTE: THE AMI USED FOR THIS INSTANCE IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN us-east-1.**
PublicRouteTable and PublicInternetRoute|Creates a route to the internet through the Internet Gateway.
PrivateRouteTable and PrivateInternetRoute|Creates a route to the internet through the NAT Instance.
___RouteTableAssociation|Associates each of the subnets with either PublicRouteTable (public subnets) or PrivateRouteTable (private subnets).
